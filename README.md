# Anki plugin using jisho.org

# Description

   * Plugin for anki that implements a dictionary lookup that can import results as cards into anki.
   * Primarily made for my own needs, no intentions to actively distribute.

# Status

   * Fully functional on my own system, problematic to distribute.
   * UI is messy on unix systems.

# Todo

   * Rework the way the plugin interacts with ankis internal structure, allowing a default setting that is plug and play, and options for customisation.
   * Rework the UI so that it displays properly on unix systems.

## Resources

   * [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/)
   * [Jisho](http://classic.jisho.org/)

## Extra requirements

   * bs4 (BeutifulSoup 4)
